## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity of a BinaryTreeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
* Big O space complexity of a BT search would be O(n)

## Solution
* I use preOrder() treversal method to gain all element in tree inside array
* compare the element inside output array with each other to get Maximum
