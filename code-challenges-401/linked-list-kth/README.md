# Linked List

[**Linked List**](./linked-list.js)

**Challenge**:
- Create a linked list class which has methods to `insert at head`, `find a node by value` and `print a collection` of all the nodes in the linked list.
- In current linked list, create a method to `append` in the end, a method to `insert after` a value, and another method to `insert before` value.
- In current linked list, create a method to `get k-th value` from the end... this was made easy by integrating a length counter on the linked list.
- In current linked list, create a function `zipLists` which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

**Approach & Efficiency**: A class was created along with the methods... a helper function, `fromValues` was created to help in inserting multiple values at once for testing purposes and whatnot.

**Solution**:

*run: npm test kth-from-end.test.js*
