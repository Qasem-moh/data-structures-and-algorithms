# Challenge Summary
* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity of a BinaryTreeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
* Big O space complexity of a BT search would be O(n)
